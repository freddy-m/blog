[**Bromite**](https://www.bromite.org/) is a Chromium-based browser with security and privacy enhancements built in, such as an adblocker and DNS-over-HTTPS support. It includes patches from Ungoogled Chromium and other security/privacy focused Chromium projects. However, <mark>Bromite is only available on Android at this time,</mark> making it a poor choice for users of multiple devices, especially if you need to sync between a desktop and mobile device.

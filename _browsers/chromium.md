title: Chromium
type: "Anti-Recommendation"
description: |
  Without signing into a Google Account, the open-source builds of Chromium do relatively well in terms of security and privacy. However, Chromium still does have a number of integrations with Google hardcoded into the source, and because it is designed to be as user-friendly as possible, it operates in a way that compromises transparency and user-control. And, Chromium is still directly developed by Google, who have attempted to introduce anti-consumer measures in the past as mentioned in the Google Chrome section.

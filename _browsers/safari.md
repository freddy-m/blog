title: Safari
type: Worth Mentioning
description: |
  A browser option on macOS and iOS with a strong focus on security and [privacy](https://www.apple.com/safari/docs/Safari_White_Paper_Nov_2019.pdf). <mark>We believe Safari is an acceptable choice for Apple users,</mark> despite Safari being a proprietary browser, because Apple users are already trusting a proprietary operating system to run their programs on. We do not recommend using iCloud Sync, which saves your bookmarks and history in a way which allows Apple to view them. Additionally, [WebKit](https://webkit.org), the browser engine powering Safari *is* open source.

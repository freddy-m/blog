**Google Chrome** is completely controlled by Google, and taps into your browsing history to track you across the web and serve you targeted advertisements. Because of Google's interest in increased ad revenues, Google Chrome offers [no privacy protections](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/06/21/google-chrome-has-become-surveillance-software-its-time-switch/) out of the box compared to Firefox, and has taken anti-consumer steps to [block common extensions like adblockers](https://www.wired.com/story/google-chrome-ad-blockers-extensions-api/). It's best to avoid this browser at all costs.
